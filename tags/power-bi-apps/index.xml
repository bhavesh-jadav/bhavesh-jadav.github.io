      <description>Power BI Apps are great way to share the content such as dashboards and reports to large Audience. But the way to categorize your content in App is very limited. Once you setup your App without specifying any landing page, you are greeted with following screen.
Power BI Apps are categorized into 3 sections, Dashboards, Reports and Datasets. Dashboards and Reports are primary focus for most of the end users. Now if you want to categorize your Dashboards and Reports further down with your own categories, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do that because Power BI does not support that yet.</description>
